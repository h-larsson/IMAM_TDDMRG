Brief descriptions of several subdirectories under ./. The subdirectories ./H2O.annihilate* below all contain annihilation operation simulations, but they differ in the complex representations, non-singlet representation, and the bond dimension schedule used for the simulations.


./H2O.annihilate
Contains annihilation operator simulation with:
  - no singlet embedding,
  - real output,
  - D schedule that increases only up to the desired value.

./H2O.annihilate-bad_d
Contains annihilation operator simulation with:
  - No singlet embedding,
  - real output,
  - D schedule that increases only up to the desired value.

./H2O.annihilate-ocpx
Contains annihilation operator simulation with:
  - With singlet embedding,
  - complex output,
  - D schedule that increases up to a value larger than the desired value.

./H2O.annihilate-ocpx-nose
Contains annihilation operator simulation with:
  - No singlet embedding,
  - complex output,
  - D schedule that increases up to a value larger than the desired value.

./H2O.orbitals
Contains orbital calculations for H2O using HF. Orbitals under this directory are used as the site/active orbitals for all example simulations in TDDMRG_CM/examples/H2O.
