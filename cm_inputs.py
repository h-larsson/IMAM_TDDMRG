def get_inputs(inp_file):
    '''
    This function returns a dictionary containing the input parameters and their values
    as key-value pairs.
    
    To define a new input parameters, first decide whether this new input parameter is 
    mandatory or optional parameter. If it is a mandatory input, then simply add the 
    following line after the 'inputs = {}' below
       inputs['new_input'] = new_input
    where new_input is to be replaced with the intended name of the new input. On the
    other hand, if the new input is optional, do the following steps.
       1) If the default value of this optional input does not depend on any other 
          parameters, then add the following line anywhere after the 'inputs = {}' line 
          below
             try:
                 inputs['new_input'] = new_input
             except NameError:
                 inputs['new_input'] = defvals.def_new_input
          Then, add this line inside defvals.py
             def_new_input = <value>
          where def_new_input is to be replaced with the intended name of the variable that
          holds the default value for this optional input, and <value> is the default value.
       2) If the default value depends on some parameters and can be determined here (e.g. 
          the input prefix below, whose default value depends on the input file name), then 
          replace the inputs['new_input'] = defvals.def_new_input line in point 1) 
          above with the appropriate line(s) that involve the dependency parameters.
          The addition of the corresponding default parameter inside defvals.py is 
          unnecessary in this case since the default value has been calculated here.
       3) If the default value depends on some parameters and can only be determined later
          in the program, then replace the right-hand side of the 
          inputs['new_input'] = defvals.def_new_input line in point 1) above with the string
          'DEFINE_LATER'. And later in the code when this input is about to be used for the 
          first time, do the assignment in the following way:
             if inputs['new_input'] == 'DEFINE_LATER':
                 <the appropriate lines to determine the value of inputs['new_input']>
    
    The newly defined input parameter can then be referred to by invoking inputs['new_input'] 
    inside cm_dmrg assuming that the output of this function is stored in a variable called 
    inputs. 
    
    It is strongly encouraged that any newly defined inputs are added such that all 
    mandatory inputs are defined before all optional inputs in their approppriate section 
    (marked by a comment line such as #=== abcde ===# below).
