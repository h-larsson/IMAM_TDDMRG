mps_info = MPSInfo(0)
mps_info.load_data(tmpdir + "/" + fname)
mps = MPS(mps_info)
mps.load_data()


1) What exactly do these functions do?
      mps.save_data() : tag, qn 
      mps.save_mutable() : tensors
      mps_info.save_data() : qn  , came later
      mps_info.save_mutable() : bonddim


      mps.deallocate()
      

2) What exactly are the difference between?
      mps_info.save_data(path)
      mps.info.save_data(path)


3) There seems to be two categories of files describing an MPS, the one that is produced by
      mps_info.save_data(path),
   (for example the "GS_MPS_INFO" file) and the other one that uses the tag in the file.
   Usually the second category include the site index in their filenames?
   Are these two categories of MPS-describing file equivalent or complementary?


Do autocorrelation.

Two ways of initiating MPS_info:
 - load_data() 
 - via hamiltonian
